Hello, my name is Duyen Dang and I also go with Cindy Dang. I am a Senior at The University of Houston, majoring in Computer Science and I will be graduating in May 2025. I love learning how to code, either in my school or online classes that I found online!

I had a chance to know about Computer Science since sophomore year during my High school. I am most comfortable with Java since I have been I knew it since High school, basic SQL and how to use GUI within Java. I also learnt to code in C++, Python, SQL and read in many more programming languages. I discovered my interest towards the fields during High school and decide to follow this career path.
